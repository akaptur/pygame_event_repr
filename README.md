An exploration of objects in python via duplication of the way Pygame prints events.

A simple call to 'print event' yields a very useful, information-dense printout.  An example:
<code><Event(4-MouseMotion {'buttons': (0, 0, 0), 'pos': (15, 0), 'rel': (-304, -239)})></code>

Python's built-in methods and attributes of objects make creation of this sort of repr function a snap, as demonstrated here.
